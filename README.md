### Sitemap

-main menu page(start button and hero library)
-start run page which will let you select heroes before every run
-transition to board game page
-on board game page i will use states to render active turn.
-board page will also need to contain all the logic available for combat. and a next round button.
-a defeat page and victory page

### Mockups


Provide visuals of your app's screens. You can use tools like Figma or pictures of hand-drawn sketches.

### Data

data would be used to render enemies and heroes, the api call objects would provide the card design and card attributes.

### Endpoints

since this api will only render cards only a get request would be necessary, perhaps adding a post to make a scoreboard.

### Auth

Not for now.

## Roadmap

1-build a basic page for two 3 vs 3 cards and focus on building game logic(backend)
2-once basic game logic is set up react front end will be built for board page
3-styling and animation for card hover, attacking/defending and active player
4-drawing card animation with randomizing which cards are drawn
5-build api calls to dynamically generate the 3vs3 cards and card drawn into hand
6-once combat is functional, begin process of building the other pages with correcting routing.

## Nice-to-haves

-i'd like to add more complex card effects
-more heroes and drawings, these are hand made so they will be added as more are produced.
-a more complex game design, adding potential for a rogue lite mechanic where every run (win or lose) players would be rewarded with new cards to make next runs easier. this would add a greater sense of progression.
-wayyyyyy down the line would be animating all monsters and heroes.
